# Power-Consumption-Prediction-ML-Kaggle-Hackathon-by-Blend360
**Description**

You have been hired as a Data science consultant by the Electricity board of Hyderabad to predict power consumption across three zones across the city. Your forecasts will help the electricity board to plan for the projected electricity requirements and make necessary agreements to avoid at shortfall of power to the city. You’ll develop models trained on historical power consumption data across the three zones. Besides the power consumption data, you will also have some other parameters that can impact the power consumption in a region. With reasonable efforts, you should be able to get to a MAPE performance of less than 6%.

**Evaluation**

Submissions are evaluated on MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) between predicted and actual values. Final evaluation metric is the mean of the MAPEs calculated for three zones. Submission Format: For each DateTime you must predict the power consumption for all 3 zones. The file should contain a header and have the following format: DateTime, Zone 1 Power Consumption, Zone 2 Power Consumption, Zone 3 Power Consumption 2017-12-01 00:00:00,37237.94,28259.26,38923.04 2017-12-01 00:10:00,16652.03,26271.69,22312.31 2017-12-01 00:20:00,31705.53,30985.58,23373.82 2017-12-01 00:30:00,46446.41,23514.69,6275.89 etc.
